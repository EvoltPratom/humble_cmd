# Running your scripts after command prompt starts everytime

Clone the repository in your local system by using
```sh
git clone repo
```
Or for windows users without git installed, 

Enter Powershell
```sh
wget -o dir_name.zip https://github.com/EvoltPratom/humble_cmd/edit/master.zip
Expand-Archive dir_name.zip -DestinationPath dir_name
cd dir_name
```

```sh
python main.py
```
This executes the helper.py file everytime command prompt is launched
You can change the contents of helper.py to execute what ever you want instead
